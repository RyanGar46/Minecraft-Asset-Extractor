# Minecraft Asset Extractor
Rips all of the assets out of minecraft. This is a **heavly** modified version of [minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Sound_directory).

This is currently in aphal and still needs a lot of work to be done. Some of the things that I need to do before V1.0 are:
- Tidy up the code.
  - Add more comments to the code.
  - Clean up varible names.
- Make sure that it is compatible with every MC version.
- OS compatibility
  - Windows (Only OS I have access to)
  - Linux
  - Mac
- Make sure that is is user friendly.
  - GUI
- Saving last used settings.
- Pack into an .exe.
- Multithreading

Extra things that I want to add at some point:
- Dark mode.
- Full screen compatibility.
